# Existing Issues
- Double check decoy state graphs (key rate vs distance) for $f(e)=1$ vs $f(e)=1.2$
- Work through the derivation for equation (9) in the quantum repeater paper, but for the naive scheme (use $\epsilon_\text{trav}$ instead of $\epsilon_\text{sta}$). See how big of a difference that makes
- If above doesn't work, look through reference [12] to see if there's anything that can help

# Possible questions to ask
- What value of $m$ did Fig 5. use, specifically for the naive scheme?
- How to adapt rate calculation for the naive scheme (but be more specific)?
